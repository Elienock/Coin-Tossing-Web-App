# Coin-Tossing-Web-App
I used the JSP and servlet tool with the glassfish server to do this application

#The problem statement
A user wants a web based application that will allow him/her to play coin tossing game with the server. The envisaged web
application should work as follows:
• The server must toss the coin and allow the user to guess the
toss.
• If the user guesses correctly, his score must be updated and be
allowed to the toss the coin.
• If the user's guess is incorrect, the score of the server must be
updated, and the server must continue with the toss.
• Display a summary report when the user decides to end the
game.

#The report
The report should include the following information:
• The total number of tosses made.
• The total number of tosses won by the user.
• The total number of tosses won by the server
